	  <h3>Food </h3>
	<p>
	  <h5>Soups</h5>
	Soups have always played an important role in the Russian meal. The traditional staple of soups such as shchi , ukha , rassolnik , solyanka , botvinya , okroshka , and tyurya  was enlarged in the 18th to 20th centuries by both European and Central Asian staples like clear soups, pureed soups, stews, and many others.
Russian soups can be divided into at least seven large groups:
Chilled soups based on kvass, such as tyurya, okroshka, and botvinya.
Light soups and stews based on water and vegetables, such as swekolnik.
Noodle soups with meat, mushrooms, or milk.
Soups based on cabbage, most prominently shchi.
Thick soups based on meat broth, with a salty-sour base like rassolnik and solyanka.
Fish soups such as ukha.
Grain- and vegetable-based soups.
<h5>Porridge</h5>
 <p>Porridge is one of the most important dishes in the traditional Russian cuisine. Variety of cereals is based on variety of local crops. In Russian, the word kasha refers to any kind of porridge. Russian people have learned to do several varieties of cereals from whole grains to a variety of ways. The most popular cereals are buckwheat, millet, semolina, oats, barley, and rice. These cereals are traditionally cooked in milk, especially for breakfast. People add butter, salt, and sugar to taste.</p>	
<h5>Meat</h5>
	<p>In traditional Russian cuisine three basic variations of meat dishes can be highlighted:
a large boiled piece of meat cooked in a soup or porridge, and then used as second course or served cold 
offal dishes , baked in pots together with cereals; whole fowl dishes or parts of fowl , or a large piece of meat  baked on a baking tray in an oven, so-called "zharkoye".</p>
	<h5>Pelmeni </h5>
	<p> Pelmeni are a traditional Eastern European (mainly Russian) dish usually made with minced meat filling, wrapped in thin dough (made out of flour and eggs, sometimes with milk or water added). For filling, pork, lamb, beef, or any other kind of meat can be used; mixing several kinds is popular. The traditional Ural recipe requires the filling be made with 45% of beef, 35% of lamb, and 20% of pork. Traditionally, various spices, such as pepper, onions, and garlic, are mixed into the filling.</p>
	<h5>Shashlyk</h5>
	<p>Shashlyk is a form of Shish kebab (marinated meat grilled on a skewer) popular in former Soviet Union countries, notably in Georgia, Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. It often features alternating slices of meat and onions.</p>
	<h5>Fish</h5>
	<p>Fish was important in pre-revolutionary cuisine, especially on Russian Orthodox fast days when meat was forbidden, similar to the Catholic custom of eating fish instead of meat on Fridays. Strictly freshwater fish such as carp and sudak  were commonly eaten in inland areas, as well as anadromous sturgeon and in northern areas salmon, pike and trout. </p>
	<h5>Pies and pancakes</h5>
	<p>Pirozhki  are small stuffed buns (pies) made of either yeast dough or short pastry. They are filled with one of many different fillings and are either baked (the ancient Slavic method).Blini are thin pancakes made with yeasted batter which are often served in connection with a religious rite or festival. The word "blin" (singular of blini) comes from Old Slavic "mlin", which means "to mill". Blins had a somewhat ritual significance for early Slavic peoples in pre-Christian times since they were a symbol of the sun, due to their round form. They were traditionally prepared at the end of the winter to honor the rebirth of the new sun during Maslenitsa</p>
	<h3> Tap water</h3>
	<p>The tap water in Russia is not considered safe to drink so we recommend only drinking bottled mineral water, which is readily available in hotels, shops and restaurants.</p>
  <h3>What to shop for</h3>
  <p> Today, shops are positively brimming with consumerism. Souvenirs are authentic, inexpensive and usually well-made. The trademark souvenir is the colourful decorated wooden Matryoshka doll, a set of dolls within dolls. Enamelled wooden boxes known as palekh are also popular. Perhaps the most curious hangover of Communist times is the quantity of surplus Red Army and military souvenirs. Everything from badges to important-looking peaked hats, MIG fighter jet dials fashioned into clocks and clothing is available. The ubiquitous 'fluffy brown hat', so common an image of Russia, is a must-buy.

Winter clothing such as coats and boots are often less expensive in Russia, as is winter sports equipment. If you ever fancied replicating the on-ice exploits of Torvill and Dean, ice-skates are far cheaper in Russia. Watches previously made for the Russian military are available in myriad designs while camera and lens brands such as FED, Kiev and Zorki have a respected following amongst enthusiasts, though be sure to do your research before buying as quality does vary.</p>
   <h3>Tips</h3>
   <p>Tipping is generally practised across the service industry in Russia and it's customary to leave a 10% tip when eating out. Taxi fares are metered so there's no need to leave a tip though the final amount is usually rounded up. </p>
   <h3>Visiting Churches in Russia</h3>
   <p>When visiting churches, cathedrals and monasteries women need to cover their heads and bare shoulders with scarves often provided on entry. At some religious places women are also required to wear a long wrap-around skirt, which are also provided to allow entry. For men, shorts and hats are not appropriate attire for visiting churches.</p>
   <h3>WiFi</h3>
   <p>WiFi is widely available across Russia's cities and larger towns with the majority of hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes offering free WiFi for patrons. In Moscow and St Petersburg you'll have no difficultly getting online if you have your own WiFi device (a phone or tablet) and it's usually high-speed internet. In the more rural areas the WiFi may be a little slower but if it's a town on the tourist route then at least you'll have the option.</p>
   <h3>Time zone</h3>
   <p>European Russia (west of the Urals) is 3 hours ahead of Greenwich Meantime (GMT). As Russia no longer observes Daylight Saving Time, from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October, Russia is 2 hours ahead of GMT.

Russia is divided into 11 time zones with the furthest point of eastern Russia 12 hours ahead of GMT. The city of Yekaterinburg falls in a different time zone to Moscow and St Petersburg and is 5 hours ahead of GMT. All timetables on Russian Railways follow Moscow Time while airports follow local time.</p>
